go back to being non sudoer/unprivileged user

now do a module show or module avail.

Confirm the packages you want are there and installed correctly and so are their dependencies.

Once you have that in order call the packages/modules you want

example:

module load gcc
module load openmpi
module load r/3.5.0

and so on.

Now run as you normally would.
